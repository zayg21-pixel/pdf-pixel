https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/6305 - SHAAAADINGS!
halftones
rework graphics stack, try-catch for operation execution. Don't check for predefined operators
clear stack after each operator (we need a reliable way to distinguish booleans, need a separate type!)
Overwrite CLUT in separation/DeviceN, we can't apply it reliably as CLUT.
We need to skip DeviceN/Separation for images as we can't apply tint transform reliably.
Finally rework ColorSpace parsing to be fully spec compliant
Shading ExtXState
Overprint and Knockout, and other print related stuff (do we need it)
Marked content and structure elements (Tagged PDF)
extent bug
process clip by text (Type 3?)
find out where those weird custom encodings are
differentiate between embedded and system fonts for cmap
UseCMap implemented incorrectly
PDF has Null. Often in array. Need to handle it properly.
