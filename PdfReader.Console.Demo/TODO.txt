Leftovers:
Add AES decryption and all other algorithms
Add missing stream filters implementations
Add JPEG2000 decoder and JBIG2 decoder
apply patterns to stencil image
Type3 font
Predefined CMaps
rework graphics stack, try-catch for operation execution. Don't check for predefined operators
clear stack after each operator (we need a reliable way to distinguish booleans, need a separate type!)
Shading ExtXState
differentiate between embedded and system fonts for cmap
PDF has Null. Often in array. Need to handle it properly.
MMType1 font (need example, only found CFF MM)
TR curves for GS and SoftMask
